Project/Task Contributions

Developed and enhanced enterprise applications including User Module, Fund Commons, and VAP.

Wrote JUnit test cases for service-layer and repository-layer methods, improving test coverage and reliability.

Migrated applications from Java 11 to Java 17, ensuring compatibility and smoother performance.

Worked on service implementation logic and optimized queries in Spring Data JPA for KPI reports and batch jobs.

Integrated with SGIAM (authentication platform) to extract user details and roles from tokens.

Contributed to CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, and explored Docker/Kubernetes for containerized deployments.

Collaborated in Agile ceremonies (Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Retrospectives) and worked closely with BA and leads to deliver features on time.

Projects / Personal Initiatives

Real Estate Management Platform (Personal Project): Built a full-stack web app with Angular SSR, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Recipe Book Application (Personal Project): Developed a CRUD-based recipe manager with role-based access, responsive UI, and PostgreSQL backend.

ðŸ“ˆ Areas of Improvement

Core Java & Advanced Concepts: Strengthen knowledge in multithreading, collections performance, and Java 17 advanced features.

Spring Boot & Microservices: Improve in-depth understanding of microservices architecture, exception handling strategies, and Spring Security.

Angular (Advanced): Gain more expertise in state management (NgRx), SSR optimizations, and performance improvements.

Database Optimization: Enhance skills in query tuning, indexing strategies, and handling large datasets in PostgreSQL.

DevOps Tools: Practice Docker & Kubernetes deployments in real-world scenarios; deepen knowledge of CI/CD pipeline automation with Jenkins.

Problem-Solving & DSA: Improve coding efficiency through regular practice (LeetCode/HackerRank) to strengthen interview readiness.

Soft Skills: Continue improving communication, documentation, and presentation skills for better collaboration with cross-functional teams.

ðŸš€ Action Plan for Next Quarter

Dedicate weekly time for Java + Spring Boot deep dive (especially microservices & security).

Practice Angular advanced features by enhancing existing personal projects.

Work on SQL query optimization exercises and performance monitoring in PostgreSQL.

Set up end-to-end CI/CD with Jenkins + Docker + Kubernetes for a personal project.

Solve at least 3â€“4 coding problems per week to sharpen problem-solving skills.

Seek regular feedback from manager and peers to continuously improve.
