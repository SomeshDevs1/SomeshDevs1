Hi Divya,

Please find below the details you asked for:
	1.	Status at the start of the sprint:
At the beginning of the sprint, we had received the SGIAM response, but I was blocked at the usergroup part — specifically the teams mapping section. Harsh helped me with a solution to proceed.
	2.	Effort spent in this sprint and on which service:
	•	Most of the time was spent on the usermodule service, as it is the base for all the microservices.
	•	Worked on implementing the required changes as per Harsh’s suggestions, including modifying the code to comply with Sonar standards and avoiding potential issues.
	•	Integrated and tested followup and fund services to fetch and push team data.
	•	Additional time was spent on complex parts like mapping usergroup and teams, ensuring DTO alignment with older structures.
	3.	Microservices completed and pending:
	•	Completed: usermodule, followup, and fund services are connected and tested.
	•	Pending: Remaining services are yet to be tested and verified in local to ensure they point to the new snapshot version and function correctly.
	•	Minor changes remain for final cleanup, such as removing old/unused code and creating new user profiles for roles like EXPERT UTILISATOR.
	4.	Time needed in the next sprint:
I will try my best to complete the implementation and conduct local testing by Monday.
In the next sprint, I estimate:
	•	2 days for any major corrections post code review (if applicable),
	•	1 day for smaller fixes,
	•	1 day with Harsh for core testing and validations.

Let me know if anything needs more clarification.
